# gaussian_mm
This is a model on Gaussian Mixture Models, they are probability distributions that consist of multiple Gaussian distributions.


## Overview

This is useful for modeling more complex data, that has multiple peaks. Sometimes one bell curve isn't enough. We can optimize
this model for clustering so that we can classify the data into the discovered classes using the Expectation Maximization
algorithm. 

## Dependencies

* numpy (for probability density functions)
* matplotlib
* scipy
* seaborn

Install missing dependencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Usage
